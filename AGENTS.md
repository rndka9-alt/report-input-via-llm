# Module Structure Guide

## Goal

- Keep module boundaries explicit.
- Make public APIs small and obvious.
- Hide internal implementation details.
- Refactor structure without breaking callers.

## Shared Rules

1. A module is a directory by default.
2. A single-file module is allowed only when the code is still very small and has no meaningful internal structure.
3. External code must import only through the module's public entry:
   - `index.ts`
   - `index.tsx`
   - or the single-file module itself
4. `index.ts` and `index.tsx` are re-export only. Do not put runtime logic in them.
5. Do not use `export *` in module entry files. Re-export only the functions, types, and components that are intentionally public.
6. Keep implementation details private. Code outside a module must not import its internal files directly.
7. Inside the same parent module, sibling submodules may import each other only through each sibling's public entry.
8. Do not import another submodule's internal files directly, even from inside the same parent module.
9. Split code by responsibility. Do not force one function per file, but split when a file starts carrying multiple responsibilities.
10. Types, constants, and small helpers should stay near the code that owns them until real reuse appears.
11. Avoid vague names such as `common`, `misc`, or `helper`.
12. Keep module dependencies directional. Avoid circular imports between sibling modules.

## Renderer Rules

Use ownership and UI responsibility as the main grouping rule.

- Prefer feature-oriented names such as `tabs`, `status-panel`, `visual-asset-manager`, `dialog`, or `tab-bar`.
- Small hooks that are private to one UI module should stay under that module, for example `tab-bar/_hooks`.
- Form- or usage-oriented folders such as `hooks`, `components`, and `utils` should be visually marked with an underscore prefix:
  - `_hooks`
  - `_components`
  - `_utils`
- `model`, `types`, `constants`, and `internal` are valid as secondary structure inside a renderer module when they improve clarity.
- Do not promote every small custom hook into a standalone top-level module just because it has a name.

## Main And Shared Rules

Use domain or service responsibility as the main grouping rule.

- Prefer names such as `session`, `runtime`, `claude-mcp`, `diagnostics`, `platform`, `status`, or `window`.
- Do not use `utils`, `types`, or `constants` as the primary top-level split when the code can first be grouped by responsibility.
- `_utils` is secondary structure inside a responsibility-focused module when technical helpers need to be grouped by usage or form.
- `types`, `constants`, and `internal` are secondary structure inside a responsibility-focused module.

Good:

```text
terminal/
  claude-mcp/
  session/
  runtime/
```

Bad:

```text
terminal/
  utils/
  types/
  constants/
```

Good:

```text
tab-bar/
  index.ts
  TabBar.tsx
  _hooks/
```

## Promotion Rules

Promote a folder into its own submodule when several of these become true:

- It has a clear responsibility that can be named.
- It keeps growing beyond a few files.
- It starts needing its own `types`, `hooks`, `utils`, `model`, or `internal`.
- Other files begin to rely on it through an obvious entry point.
- Its internal imports become denser than its connection to the rest of the parent module.

A submodule may be:

- public to the app
- private to its parent module

If it is large enough to deserve structure, give it its own entry point even when it stays private.

## Testing Rules

- Prefer tests that assert behavior through a module's public API.
- Internal tests are allowed for complex pure logic, branch-heavy transforms, or regression-prone logic.
- Do not couple tests to file layout unless there is a strong reason.

## Type Safety Rules

- Do not use type assertions such as `as`, non-null assertions such as `!`, or double assertions to silence compile errors.
- Prefer type guards, null checks, discriminated unions, and control-flow narrowing to prove types to TypeScript.
- If a runtime boundary requires validation, validate the value at the boundary instead of asserting deeper in the code path.

## Verification And Reporting

- After making changes, run `pnpm test` to verify both type errors and tests before reporting completion.
- If `pnpm test` cannot be run, or if it fails, report that clearly instead of implying the work is fully verified.
- If you discover type errors, test failures, or worktree changes that were not caused by the current session's work, report them to the user explicitly.
- Do not silently overwrite, revert, or "clean up" unrelated changes just to make the current task pass.

## Refactoring Standard

- Create structure only when it improves boundaries and ownership.
- Do not add folder depth just for symmetry.
- Optimize for clear imports, clear ownership, and low-friction refactoring.
